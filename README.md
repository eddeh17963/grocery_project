# Grocery Item Stats Comparer

This project will compare data between foods in various 
grocery stores, and is specifically optimized o help 
you find the best price

currently I have only added kroger, but I will implement more 
stores in the future

*note, the api key is stored as an environment variable, so 
you will have to make a file that includes this information 
and ensure that the python file points to the right location*
